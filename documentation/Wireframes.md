# Balsamiq Wireframes

## Overview
Balsamiq wireframes were used to create mid-fidelity designs for the University Event Tracker app, refining the structure visualized in the low-fidelity sketches. These wireframes offer a more detailed look at the user interface while maintaining a focus on functionality over aesthetics.

## Key Screens
1. Home Screen:
   - A list of upcoming events categorized by type.
   - Search bar and filter options.
   
2. Event Details Page:
   - Event information such as time, date, location, and description.
   - Register button that leads to confirmation.
   
3. My Events Page:
   - A list of events the user has registered for, with reminders and event details.

## Design Decisions
- Consistency: The wireframes maintain consistent spacing, typography, and iconography across all screens to ensure a smooth user experience.
- User-Friendly Navigation: The navigation bar is placed at the bottom of the screen for easy thumb access on mobile devices.
- Feedback Mechanism: After registering for an event, the wireframes include a confirmation page to reassure the user that the process was successful.
