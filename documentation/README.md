# University Event Tracker Application

## Overview
This project is a research and design exploration for an application that helps university students track and register for upcoming events. The focus is on user experience and intuitive navigation, with prototype designs created using low-fidelity sketches and Balsamiq wireframes.

The application includes features like:
- Event discovery based on categories
- Event registration and reminders
- Event history and personalized recommendations

## Repository Structure
- `balsamiq-designs/`: Contains wireframes and design prototypes made with Balsamiq.
- `diagrams/`: Includes user flow diagrams and structure charts.
- `documentation/`: Contains all documentation related to the design process, research, and prototypes.
- `low-fidelity-prototypes/`: Contains images of the low-fidelity sketches and mockups.

## How to Use
This repository is for showcasing research and design work only. There is no practical implementation of the app at this stage. You can view the prototypes and documentation to understand the design process.

## Tools Used
- Balsamiq for wireframes
- Hand-drawn sketches for low-fidelity prototypes
- GitHub for project management
