# Design Process

## Project Overview
The University Event Tracker app is intended to simplify event management for students by providing a platform to discover, register, and manage events hosted by the university. The project went through several design phases, starting from ideation to low-fidelity wireframes.

## Design Phases
1. Ideation: Brainstorming sessions were conducted to identify core features like event registration, reminders, and categories.
2. User Research: Insights from student feedback were used to shape the event categories and the UI's simplicity.
3. Prototyping: Low-fidelity prototypes were created, first with sketches, followed by detailed wireframes in Balsamiq.

## Goals
- Ensure intuitive navigation for students.
- Minimize the number of steps required to find and register for events.
- Provide a visual hierarchy that is easy to follow for both tech-savvy and non-tech-savvy users.
