# Low-Fidelity Prototypes

## Overview
Low-fidelity prototypes were created as an initial step to visualize the core functionality and user interface of the University Event Tracker app. These designs focus on the basic structure and flow without delving into detailed visuals or aesthetics.

## Prototype Breakdown
1. Home Screen: Displays upcoming events categorized by type (e.g., Academic, Social, Sports). A search bar and filter options are provided for easy navigation.
   
2. Event Details Page: When a user clicks on an event, they are taken to a detailed page with event information (time, date, location, description) and an option to register.

3. Registration Confirmation: After registering, the user is shown a confirmation page with the option to add the event to their calendar and receive notifications.

## Design Choices
- Simple Layout: The sketches focus on a clean layout with minimal distractions to allow users to find what they need quickly.
- Navigation: A bottom navigation bar is proposed to provide easy access to core sections like Home, Categories, and Registered Events.
- User Focus: Priority was given to reducing the number of clicks needed to complete key tasks like event registration.
