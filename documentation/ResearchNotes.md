# Research Notes

## Problem Statement
University students often struggle to keep track of various events happening on campus. Without a centralized system, it becomes difficult for students to discover relevant events, register, and get reminders. The University Event Tracker app is designed to address these challenges.

## Research Findings
1. Student Pain Points:
   - Difficulty finding all events in one place.
   - Lack of event reminders.
   - Too many steps in the registration process for some university systems.
   
2. Competitor Analysis:
   - Other university event systems lack intuitive navigation and a centralized category filtering system.
   - Many event management platforms are cluttered, making it hard to find relevant information quickly.

3. User Feedback:
   - Users prefer a simple and minimalistic design.
   - A need for personalized recommendations based on past event history.
   - Preference for categories and filters to streamline the event discovery process.

## Design Solutions
- Event Categories: Categorizing events by interest areas like academic, social, sports, etc.
